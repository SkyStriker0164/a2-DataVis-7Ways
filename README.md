To be honest, I think my own development project from scratch to build is extremely painful, but fortunately this to achieve the function of a lot of online tutorials, I understand the basis of these reference to their methods to complete the data visualization.

Python is really easy to use, I can easily find multiple ways to use these method to create a scatter plot, and it has more details than Altair.
